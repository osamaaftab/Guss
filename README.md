# Gousto

Requirments which I have not included in the project are:

* Database Layer for offline fetching of data
* Product detail


I couldn't able to implement as i had to complete this task with in 3 hours so i think putting db layer and making a detail UI is not some thing possible to do in 3 hours.
I am sharing a github repository of mine where the same behavior can be observed.-> https://github.com/osamaaftab/zalo
Thanks
